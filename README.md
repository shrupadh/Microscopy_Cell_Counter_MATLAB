## Title
Automatic Counting of Bacterial Cells in Fluorescence-light Microscopy Images
Medical Image Analysis 

## Introduction
Our project tackles the challenge of automating the counting of bacterial cells in fluorescence-light microscopy images, greatly enhancing precision and efficiency in quantitative microbiology.

## Prerequisites
MATLAB
Image Processing Toolbox

## Installation
No additional installation required for MATLAB users. Simply download the scripts and run.

## Usage
The main function to start the application is cellCounterApp. This GUI allows you to:

Load images
Pre-process for noise reduction and contrast enhancement
Segment and count bacterial cells
DEMO:
Images are attached.
